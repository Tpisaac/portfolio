            Iâ€™m a highly motivated individual, driven by passion for technology,
            I engaged in self-directed learning to acquire programming skills. I
            have a keen interest in technology and the power it holds in
            transforming industries. This fascination led to a significant
            career shift as I decided to venture into the field of computer
            programming. While working in the agricultural sector, I became
            increasingly aware of the role technology played in enhancing
            productivity and efficiency. Recognizing the potential for growth
            and innovation in the field of computer programming, I decided to
            embark on a new professional path. I pursued online courses, joined
            coding communities, and dedicated countless hours to learning
            languages/frameworks such as{" "}
            <span className="text-teal-500 text-1xl">
              HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, jQueary, React, Sass, Tailwind.
            </span>{" "}
            With continous learning, I hope to fufill my full potential and be
            of good service to humanity.
            <br className="mt-3" />
            When I'm not coding, I'm probably at the gym putting in the work or
            with my wife and kids at the beach having a good time.
